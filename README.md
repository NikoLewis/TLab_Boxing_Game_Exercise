<h2>Goal and requirements</h2>

When the program runs on your browser, it will display a heading of `Mad Libs Exercise` underneath the heading you should see your own Mad-lib. Do not use this example, you will create your own Mad Lib

### example output:

**Mad Libs Exercise**

> When the program runs, it alternates hits between the two boxers, displaying the results of each hit until one boxer is knocked out. Below you can see the desired output you should find in your VSCode terminal.

```

<h2>Key learnings</h2>

- Apply if, else if, and else statements to handle different gameplay scenarios (e.g., basic hit, critical hit, knockout) to exemplify understanding of conditional branching.

- Using conditionals to determine game outcomes and player health status, students will problem-solve and troubleshoot their projects to create functional gameplay via the VSCode terminal


>If project has been improved after submission, here is a good place to specify it.
